          Ludum Dare is a huge "game jam" community which happens every few months. Thousands
          of indie developers come together and pledge a weekend to creating a game from scratch, either
          individually or as a group. This is a collection of all the games I've made during this contest,
          and you can find more information about it yourself by visiting the website:

                My first ludum dare game. I created a custom engine
                entirely from javascript+HTML5. It was an awesome time and really
                the foundation of most future ludum dare games that I made. The theme, as I recall,
                as "under the surface" or something like that. So in this game, you shoot off the surface
                of a planet in order to "mine" the resources.

                I was feeling wholly uninspired during this ludum dare. After the first night
                I had decided to give up entirely and went to bed angry. The next morning I realized
                that was foolish and so I just threw ideas on a page and rolled with it. Apparently
                those ideas were "space" and "vikings". I'm not sure what the theme was, but all in all
                it was a fun time. My first attempt at a sort of resource management game.

                My foray into using physics engines and bullet time. An arena-style
                survival game where you destroy the attacking zombies until you can
                survive no longer. I had always wanted to play with a physics engine though
                sadly, this game did not turn out how I wanted. I almost think it would
                have been better to write my own physics engine for all the time I wasted
                trying to just get the engine bootstrapped! But in the end, I did finish
                about as much as I wanted in the short time I had.
